# GCX

GCX is an app concept designed to bring business cards to the 21st century, allowing users to share details remotely in a sustainable manner.

Designs for an app concept. This was presented at the takeoff challenge in Southampton, the team won Â£3000. I did the vector graphics for the pitch deck and the app designs using photoshop and illustrator.
